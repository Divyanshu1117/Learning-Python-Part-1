# 1.) if-elif-else ladder in Python

# a = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# if (a < 3):
#     print("The value of a is less than 3")
# elif (a < 7):
#     print("The value of a is less than 7")
# elif (a > 13):
#     print("The value of a is greater than 13")
# elif (a > 17):
#     print("The value of a is greater than 17")
# else:
#     print("The value is not less than 3, less than 7, or greater than 13/17")

# print("Done")

# 2.) Multiple if statements

# a = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# if (a < 3):
#     print("The value of a is less than 3")

# if (a < 7):
#     print("The value of a is less than 7")

# if (a > 13):
#     print("The value of a is greater than 13")

# if (a > 17):
#     print("The value of a is greater than 17")

# if not (a < 3 or a < 7 or a > 13 or a > 17):
#     print("The value does not match any condition")

# print("Done")

age = int(input("Enter you age: "))
if (age >= 18):
    print("Yes, now that you are 18, you can drive a bike, car, bus, scooter, Activa, truck, tractor, or JCB.")
else:
    print("Go ride a bicycle, you are not old enough yet to drive a bike, car, bus, scooter, Activa, truck, tractor, or JCB.")
